"""
Design and implement a data structure for a compressed string iterator. The given compressed string will
 be in the form of each letter followed by a positive integer representing the number 
 of this letter existing in the original uncompressed string.

Implement the StringIterator class:

next() Returns the next character if the original string still has uncompressed characters, otherwise returns a white space.
hasNext() Returns true if there is any letter needs to be uncompressed in the original string, otherwise returns false.


Input
["StringIterator", "next", "next", "next", "next", "next", "next", "hasNext", "next", "hasNext"]
[["L1e2t1C1o1d1e1"], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], []]
Output
[null, "L", "e", "e", "t", "C", "o", true, "d", true]
